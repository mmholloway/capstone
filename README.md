# ESE 498 Electrical Engineering Capstone Design Projects
Fall 2024

## Description
This project aimed to creating a signal decorrelation error mitigation algorithm for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. 
Utilizing a 30+ image dataset from the northern coast of Alaska (Drew Point, AK), we applied two denoising methods in MATLAB to identify land, water, and noise in a dataset of 50+ InSAR images.
One method was a manual denoising approach, and the other method implemented wavelet denoising with MATLAB's `wdenoise2()` function.
To compare and analyze the efficacy of our methods, we crafted and executed a two-pronged, no-reference image quality analysis approach.
